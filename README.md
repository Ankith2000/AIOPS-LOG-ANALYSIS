This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) can be applied to log analysis using Python
and machine learning, specifically for anomaly detection in system logs.

---------------------------------------------
🔍 Project Objectives

Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns or spikes in log behavior.
Root Cause Analysis: Trace anomalies back to potential sources.
Predictive Maintenance: Forecast potential failure based on historical logs.
Alert Prioritization: Automatically categorize alerts based on severity.
Automated Remediation (Future Scope): Trigger actions when anomalies are detected.
